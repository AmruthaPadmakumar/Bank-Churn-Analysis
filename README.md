# Bank-Churn-Analysis
A certain bank in North America wants to perform customer churn analysis as the credit card business of the bank is not performing very well.
Churn analysis will help the bank evaluate the customers who have stopped purchasing the credit card of the bank and figure out measures to reduce the bankâ€™s customer loss rate.
# Conclusion of Analysis:
Based on the analysis of the bank churn data, it is evident that customer retention is a critical area that requires immediate attention.
The churn rate of approximately 16.80% signals the need for proactive strategies to reduce attrition and improve customer loyalty. 
Targeted retention efforts are essential for vulnerable segments, including lower-income customers, females, and the age group between 40 to 50. 
Additionally, focusing on customer retention in England, despite higher attrition, presents an opportunity to maximize revenue.
Adopting a customer-centric approach and delivering exceptional experiences are key to fostering long-term customer loyalty and sustaining a competitive advantage in the banking industry.
